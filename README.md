# Mars
Module 11 Challenge


Part One
First I opened the browser and followed the link the the Mars website. 

I then inspected the website to find where the text data was listed. 

Then I looped through the the text data to pull the title and the preview text, and printed it. 

Part Two
I once again followed the link using beautiful soup to be able to scrape more data. 

I extracted the table using the inspect feauture. 

I used the already pulled data to find where the columns were defined as well as the rows. 

I looped through the pulled data to create an ordered list of data to be able to format a table that would be easily readable and then turned into a dataframe. 

I researched the dtyped of each column then reformatted them to be usable for calculations. 

I used the previouly created table to be able to find the unique value counts of months and used the unique value sol and lenght of it to calculate the martian days in the data. 

I used the month calculations to group the data and find the average temperature and put it in a dataframe. 

The previously calculated data was used to fine the next few graphs and finally I exported the table to a csv file.
